# Parser
Designed a recursive descent parser from scratch from the given project specifications required. Parser was designed to recognize user input and build data structures at run time, then the data structures were to be executed upon end of input. Parser was required to read input formatted as C++ code and build data structures based on various variable declarations. Parser was also required to build custom data structures to store scoping information and have the data structure behave as a normal compiler would in regards to static scoping. The parser would read various scopes even nested scopes and check for variable declarations. Then if a user inputted a variable name within a scope, the parser would trace the custom graphed data structure and locate if the variable exists in an accessible outer scope and print its value. If the variable was listed as private or outside of a nested scope there will be no results. Overall the project goal was to create a program that evaluates static scoping principles similar to any traditional compiler.
